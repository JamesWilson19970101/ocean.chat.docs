# Implementation Steps

## Organizational Chat

First, mimic other platforms to implement the organizational chat function.

## Organizational + Personal Chat

Consider how to make the organization accessible to individuals. This can be achieved using a resource lobby.

Once these two steps are completed, monetization can begin.

For example, education (tutors, fitness coaches, etc.) combined with users can already generate revenue.

## Personal Chat

Consider how to make it entirely accessible to individual users. Here, we need to assume that individuals are "useful."

When introducing this feature, we need to consider that individuals can use their own PCs as servers.

## AI-Generated Profiles

Generate AI profiles based on chat content.

## Consider how to create personal profiles in real time.

## Introduction of Blockchain Technology

Put resources on the blockchain.

## Establishment of a Virtual World

After putting resources on the blockchain, establish a virtual world to enable transactions.
